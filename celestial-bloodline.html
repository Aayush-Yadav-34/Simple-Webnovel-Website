                <h2>Celestial Bloodline</h2>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>After awakening a low talent compared to the kids his age, Kyle was ridiculed and looked down upon by others.<br>

                    That's why he stopped working hard. He knew the world which was filled with danger only followed the strong but there was nothing he could do.<br>
                    
                    "What's the point of working so hard when my potential is low?"<br>
                    
                    One day his brother suggested him to give the Royal Academy test just so Kyle could gain some experience.<br>
                    
                    Kyle was stunned, not believing that his brother was asking him to take the test!!<br>
                    
                    He knew there was no way a person who didn't even work hard after awakening his talent would be able to pass the test of one of the biggest Academy in the Kingdom.<br>
                    
                    Nevertheless even after knowing he would never be able to pass the test, Kyle decided to give it a go only for his family.</p><br>
