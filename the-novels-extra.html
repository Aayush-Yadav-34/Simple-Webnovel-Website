                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>Waking up, Kim Hajin finds himself in a familiar world but an unfamiliar body.<br>

                    A world he created himself and a story he wrote, yet never finished.<br>
                    
                    He had become his novel’s extra, a filler character with no importance to the story.<br>
                    
                    The only clue to escaping is to stay close to the main storyline.<br>
                    
                    However, he soon finds out the world isn’t exactly identical to his creation.</p>
