                <h2>Lightning Is the Only Way</h2>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>With a father as strong as the highest heavens themselves, Gravis wasn't required to step into the cold and ruthless world of cultivation.<br>

                    But when Heaven used him in a scheme to get back at his father, Gravis realized that he needed strength to gain true freedom.<br>
                    
                    As long as he remained his weak self, he would always remain beneath Heaven’s oppression. Only true power brings true freedom.<br>
                    
                    To gain strength, Gravis ventured into the lower worlds to start his cultivation under true life and death tempering.<br>
                    
                    Only a strong will, which had been forged in striving for every resource available, would allow him to reach the peak.<br>
                    
                    Heaven’s strongest weapon was Lightning of Divine Punishment, and only if he made this weapon his, would he have a chance.<br>
                    
                    So, to overthrow Heaven,<br>
                    
                    Lightning Is the Only Way!<br>
                    
                    Yet, the path to power is painful.<br>
                    
                    Not everyone reaches the peak.<br>
                    
                    But Gravis will!<br>
                    
                    No matter how much pain he feels along the way!</p><br>
