                <h2>The Bloodline System</h2>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>In a future timeline, the earth was visited by a species known as the Slarkovs.<br>
                    Having lost their home planet and in search of a new one, earth was the next habitable planet for them.<br><br>
                    
                    Humans and Slarkovs made a deal with each other in return for the Slarkovs living on earth.<br>
                    The Slarkovs traded their technology and knowledge for a new home.<br>
                    They were similar to humans except for some of them who had slight differences so fitting into the society wasn't a problem.<br>
                    Over the years Slarkovs and humans began to mate with one another and reproduce offsprings.<br>
                    This in turn created a new species known as the mixed-blood.<br>
                    Centuries later mixedbloods could tap into their bloodline and perform unimaginable feats.<br><br>
                    
                    Gustav born into an age where bloodline determines everything, struggles to fit with a useless bloodline.<br>
                    His bloodline only grants him the ability to change his hair color, destroying his hopes and dreams for a great future.<br>
                    His fate is turned around when an unexpected situation leads to him finding a system that grants him the power to unlock and upgrade bloodlines by completing quests but he's baffled by two quests with a five-year deadline. 
                    Success will grant him unimaginable rewards...<br>
                    But only one thing awaits him if he fails... Death!<br><br>
                    
                    Follow Gustav on his interesting journey filled with unprecedented adventures, danger and death, maybe?</p><br>
