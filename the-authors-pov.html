                <h2>The Author's POV</h2>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>The person whom the world revolves around.<br><br>

                    The person who defeats all of his opponents, and ultimately gets the beautiful girl.<br><br>
                    
                    The sole existence all villains fear.<br><br>
                    
                    That is the protagonist.<br><br>
                    
                    What about me?<br><br>
                    
                    As a failed author who had only one success throughout his whole career, I had reincarnated into my late novel.<br><br>
                    
                    «This is it»<br><br>
                    
                    I thought, as I tightly clenched my fist.<br><br>
                    
                    Did I just get reincarnated in my own novel?<br><br>
                    
                    Is this where I reincarnate in a novel and become the protagonist?<br><br>
                    
                    No.<br><br>
                    
                    Sadly it’s not that kind of novel, as I reincarnated as a mob.<br><br>
                    
                    The world doesn’t revolve around me.<br><br>
                    
                    The girls don’t come flocking towards me.<br><br>
                    
                    The cheat items don’t come to me.<br><br>
                    
                    «Phew»<br><br>
                    
                    I let out a sigh of relief.<br><br>
                    
                    «Thank god I’m not the protagonist»<br><br>
                    
                    I joyfully shouted as tears streamed down my cheeks.<br><br>
                    
                    Wait, are you curious as to why I don’t want to be the protagonist?<br><br>
                    
                    I did forget to mention the most important thing when I was describing a protagonist.<br>
                    That is…<br><br>
                    
                    They are calamity magnets.<br><br>
                    
                    I just died. If I learned something from that, it’s that it really isn’t a pleasant experience.<br><br>
                    
                    If possible let me live a long stable life.<br><br>
                    
                    Thank you, whoever reincarnated me.<br><br>
                    
                    I would later come to regret these words…</p>
