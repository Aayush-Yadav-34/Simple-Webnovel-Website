                <h2>Advent of the Three Calamities</h2>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>Emotions are like a drug to us.<br>

                    The more we experience them, the more we become addicted.<br>
                    
                    The hardest part is not letting them consume us.<br>
                    
                    But it's already too late for me.<br>
                    
                    I've already been swallowed whole.<br><br>
                    
                    ***<br><br>
                    
                    I had no knowledge of the game.<br>
                    
                    I was meant to have died.<br>
                    
                    And yet, I found myself in this situation.<br>
                    
                    A game I had never played before. A character I was unfamiliar with, and... A world that seemed to want to swallow me whole with every move I made.<br>
                    
                    What the hell is going on?<br>
                    
                    ...and who am I?</p><br>
